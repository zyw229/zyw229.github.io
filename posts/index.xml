      <description>Summary Since the introduction of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), stress level within the banking sector has been more closely tied to overall market liquidity. In this article, we explore the various channels through which bank stress affects liquidity. We revisit key metrics we&amp;rsquo;ve been watching since the SVB failure, and try to make our best projection for market liquidity for the near future.
Bank stress 77 days have passed since the SVB collapse, we have witnessed three relatively large banks failing (SVB, Signature Bank, First Republic Bank).</description>

      <description>Summary The risk asset bull run since start of 2023 has been driven by a series of favorable technical factors. However, with those factors diminishing, it must find new sources of fuel. We argue that a prolonged regional bank crisis might be necessary to sustain this bull run, while a US banking system stablization could, ironically, be the last nail in the coffin for risk assets.
Liquidity run Since start of 2023, market has been gererally upbeat despite weak fundamentals.</description>

      <description>Summary In this article, we discuss the effect of the proposed bank rescue package and why it was risk-positive for the market, and why the debate on whether this is QE is pointless. We argue that the market should only care about the fact that this rescue package achieves similar results of a QE program, at least in the short term.
One thing that caught the market&amp;rsquo;s attention last week was the sudden spike in the Fed&amp;rsquo;s balance sheet, effectively reversing the amount achieved by QT since last November.</description>
