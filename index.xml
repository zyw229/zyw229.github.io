      <description>One thing that caught the market&amp;rsquo;s attention last week was the sudden spike in the Fed&amp;rsquo;s balance sheet, effectively reserving the amount achieved by QT since last November:
There has been much debate about whether this signals the end of QT, and perhaps the beginning of the next round of QE. However, I think there is little point of debating whether this is &amp;lsquo;QE&amp;rsquo; or not. By definition, this is definitely not QE; however, it is useful to think about how this will affect the fund flows.</description>
